    //we make a var called SecondVC. It is made before we press on the Bar Item "+" sign.  It is of the class SecondViewControler.  Anything in the SecondViewControlelr class has a .var of delegate. (delegate is a var written in the SecondViewController class.  We set that delegate to equal self. This is all done right before we segue to SecondVC.  The trigger call the userDidEnterInformation method and the getSomeXtraInf method was in the @action in the SecondViewController method named sendData.  I think the line self.navigationController?.popViewControllerAnimated(true) sends the SecondVC back to FirseVC.  I am going to test it.
